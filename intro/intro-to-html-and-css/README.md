Like Atom, Sublime Text is also free (although it *will* occasionally prompt you to donate). Sublime ships with all of the features that you need in order to get started writing code, and you can extend its functionality by installing additional 'packages' as you see fit.

### PEOPLE
The net is vast and infinite, and there are no shortage of resources and perspectives for any given web-related topic. That said, here's a short list of people who are extremely invested in pushing these technologies forward, and who seem to be pretty close to all sorts of interesting projects.
